==============================================================================

To build for the X Window System:

    cd xdaliclock/X11/
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

==============================================================================

To build for MacOS X (10.4 or later) or iOS:

    cd xdaliclock/OSX/
    make

    then copy "build/Debug/DaliClock.app" to your Applications folder.

    Or, you can use the included XCode project.

==============================================================================

To build for the Pebble Smart Watch:

   cd pebble
   pebble build
   (Assuming you have the Pebble SDK installed.)

==============================================================================

To build for Android devices:

    Install JDK 7 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)
    Install Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/)
    cd xdaliclock/android/
    make
    (or you can open "DaliClock" as a project in Android Studio)

    Then copy "build/DaliClock.apk" to your Android device.

==============================================================================

To build for PalmOS Classic devices:

    cd xdaliclock/palm/
    ./configure --host=m68k-palmos --build=`../X11//Xlib-classic/config.guess`
    make CFLAGS="-O3"

    Then install daliclock.prc on your device through your usual method.

    If you don't already have a working PalmOS cross-compilation environment
    set up, you'll need to install "m68k-palmos-gcc", "pilrc", "obj-res", and
    "build-prc" first.  This can be a lot of work -- you're on your own!
    Check http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/ to find the things you need.
    Check http://www.zenonez.com/prctoolsx/ for MacOS X build tools.

==============================================================================

To build for Palm WebOS devices...

You don't really have to "build" it, because it's all Javascript!

2.18  29-Nov-1999	Oops, month number was off by one in the Palm version.
2.17  28-Nov-1999	Now uses `configure' instead of `Imake'.
			ANSI C is now required.
			Ported to Palm Pilot.
2.16  12-Nov-1999	Fixed some warnings, cleaned up the fonts some more.
2.15  11-Nov-1999	Added two new (smaller) builtin fonts, bringing the
			total to four.	The smallest one is 27 pixels high,
			and is cleaner looking than any X font I've seen at
			that size...

			PseudoColor visuals when using `-transparent'.
			Some portability fixes for OpenVMS.
			Added `xdaliclock.spec' so that everyone builds their
			RPMs in the same way.
2.13  07-Nov-1998	Put a brain-dead simple date parser in `-countdown'.

2.09  02-Jun-1997	Renamed -shape to -transparent, and made it use
			SERVER_OVERLAY_VISUALS if available -- that makes the
			option actually be *usable* on SGIs and on advanced HP,
			DEC, or IBM systems (since overlay visuals actually
			work, unlike the Shape extension.)
2.08  30-Aug-1996	Fixed a lingering bug where sometimes clicking would
			not cause the date to be displayed.
2.07  23-Feb-1996	Added WM_COMMAND property for session management.

2.06  24-Dec-1995	Made -cycle work on non-PseudoColor visuals.
			Fixed a couple of shape-related bugs.
2.05  08-Jan-1995	Fixed a silly bug in determining the visual and cmap
			to use in -root mode, which caused it to not work with
			xscreensaver when the saver wasn't using the default
			visual and cmap.
2.04  08-Nov-1994	Some fixes for SGIs and non-default visuals.
2.03  31-May-1994	Minor tweaks to Imakefile; submitted for X11r6 contrib.

			<dyson@sunfish.physics.uiowa.edu>.
2.00  16-May-1994	Converted to use Xt instead of raw Xlib.
1.07  04-Sep-1993	Fixed shape handling; some minor portability changes.
1.06  03-Feb-1993	Fixed some memory errors.
1.05  10-Jun-1992	More from Tony Kennedy: support visuals with different
			depths from default, center digits correctly in
			initial window, and merge geometry defaults in a more
			sophisticated way.  Merged in a slightly reworked
			version of more general segment-handling code from
			Dan Wallach <c169-bg@auriga.berkeley.edu>.  Added a
			second, even bigger builtin font.  Added the -root
			and -fullscreen arguments.
1.04  04-Jun-1992	More VMS support for resource database files, from
			Tony Kennedy <adk@scri.fsu.edu>.
1.03  16-Jan-1992	Added more intelligent visual support.
			Made it not die on fonts without per-char info.
1.02  03-Jan-1992	Merged in VMS support from Daniel C. Newman
			<dan@innosoft.com>.
1.01  26-Oct-1991	Fixed Expose handling in -noseconds mode;
			access() called with too few args;
			added resource for MM/DD/YY, DD/MM/YY, etc.
1.00  07-Oct-1991	Submitted for X11r5 contrib tape.
