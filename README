==============================================================================

To build for the X Window System:

    cd xdaliclock/X11/
    ./configure
    make
    make install

There's also an unfinished GTK port in here.  See gtk/README for details.

==============================================================================

To build for MacOS X (10.4 or later) or iPhone:

    cd xdaliclock/OSX/
    make

    then copy "build/Debug/DaliClock.app" to your Applications folder.

    Or, you can use the included XCode project.

==============================================================================

To build for PalmOS Classic devices:

    cd xdaliclock/palm/
    ./configure --host=m68k-palmos --build=`../config.guess`
    make CFLAGS="-O3"

Then install daliclock.prc on your device through your usual method.

If you don't already have a working PalmOS cross-compilation environment
set up, you'll need to install "m68k-palmos-gcc", "pilrc", "obj-res", and
"build-prc" first.  This can be a lot of work -- you're on your own!
Check http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/ to find the things you need.
Check http://www.zenonez.com/prctoolsx/ for MacOS X build tools.

==============================================================================

To build for Palm WebOS devices...

You don't really have to "build" it, because it's all Javascript!

                        - "Upgraded" to XCode 4.0, which means that 10.4 PPC
                          builds are impossible, and Intel is now required.

                        - Initial port!

                        - Fixed bug where the background colors of the digits
                          and of the rest of the window were slightly out of
                          sync.

    07-Sep-03 (v2.20)   Updated "vroot.h" for compatibility with latest
    07-Sep-03 (v2.20)   Updated "vroot.h" for compatibility with latest
                        xscreensaver (-root in Xinerama mode.)
                        Include various historical Macintosh predecessors in
                        the mac128/ subdirectory.
    11-Sep-02 (v2.19)   Added -window-id option, for use by xscreensaver-demo.
                        Handle exposure events in "-root -noseconds" mode.
                        Updated the PalmOS source to work with PalmOS SDK 4.0.
                        Fixed a dumb bug in the PalmOS preferences where you
                        couldn't set the FPS to exactly "10".
                        Updated make.com for VMS.
    29-Nov-99 (v2.18)   Oops, month number was off by one in the Palm version.
    28-Nov-99 (v2.17)   Now uses `configure' instead of `Imake'.
                        ANSI C is now required.
                        Ported to Palm Pilot.
    12-Nov-99 (v2.16)   Fixed some warnings, cleaned up the fonts some more.
    11-Nov-99 (v2.15)   Added two new (smaller) builtin fonts, bringing the
                        total to four.  The smallest one is 27 pixels high,
                        and is cleaner looking than any X font I've seen at
                        that size...
     4-Jan-99 (v2.14)   Fixed a bug that caused X errors on some systems with
                        PseudoColor visuals when using `-transparent'.
                        Some portability fixes for OpenVMS.
                        Added `xdaliclock.spec' so that everyone builds their
                        RPMs in the same way.
     7-Nov-98 (v2.13)   Put a brain-dead simple date parser in `-countdown'.
                        Updated my email address and home page.
     6-Nov-98 (v2.12)   Botched, please ignore.
    31-Dec-97 (v2.11)   Added cheesy `-countdown' switch.  Happy new year...
    25-Jun-97 (v2.10)   Fixed a bad interaction with xscreensaver...
     2-Jun-97 (v2.09)   Renamed -shape to -transparent, and made it use
                        SERVER_OVERLAY_VISUALS if available -- that makes the
                        option actually be *usable* on SGIs and on advanced HP,
                        DEC, or IBM systems (since overlay visuals actually
                        work, unlike the Shape extension.)
    30-Aug-96 (v2.08)   Fixed a lingering bug where sometimes clicking would
                        not cause the date to be displayed.
    23-Feb-96 (v2.07)   Added WM_COMMAND property for session management.
                        More better VMS support from Martin Zinser.
    24-Dec-95 (v2.06)   Made -cycle work on non-PseudoColor visuals.
                        Fixed a couple of shape-related bugs.
     8-Jan-95 (v2.05)   Fixed a silly bug in determining the visual and cmap
                        to use in -root mode, which caused it to not work with
                        xscreensaver when the saver wasn't using the default
                        visual and cmap.
     8-Nov-94 (v2.04)   Some fixes for SGIs and non-default visuals.
    31-May-94 (v2.03)   Minor tweaks to Imakefile; submitted for X11r6 contrib.
    21-May-94 (v2.01)   VMS and R3 support, with help from Richard L. Dyson
                        <dyson@sunfish.physics.uiowa.edu>.
    16-May-94 (v2.00)   Converted to use Xt instead of raw Xlib.
     4-Sep-93 (v1.07)   Fixed shape handling; some minor portability changes.
     3-Feb-93 (v1.06)   Fixed some memory errors.
    10-Jun-92 (v1.05)   More from Tony Kennedy: support visuals with different
                        depths from default, center digits correctly in
                        initial window, and merge geometry defaults in a more
                        sophisticated way.  Merged in a slightly reworked
                        version of more general segment-handling code from
                        Dan Wallach <c169-bg@auriga.berkeley.edu>.  Added a
                        second, even bigger builtin font.  Added the -root
                        and -fullscreen arguments.
     4-Jun-92 (v1.04)   More VMS support for resource database files, from
                        Tony Kennedy <adk@scri.fsu.edu>.
    16-Jan-92 (v1.03)   Added more intelligent visual support.
                        Made it not die on fonts without per-char info.
     3-Jan-92 (v1.02)   Merged in VMS support from Daniel C. Newman
                        <dan@innosoft.com>.
    26-Oct-91 (v1.01)   Fixed Expose handling in -noseconds mode;
                        access() called with too few args;
                        added resource for MM/DD/YY, DD/MM/YY, etc.
     7-Oct-91 (v1.00)   Submitted for X11r5 contrib tape.
