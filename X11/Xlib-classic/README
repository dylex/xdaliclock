This is jwz's original 1991 version of XDaliClock, last substantially modified
circa 1997.  It is highly tuned for the machines of the Twentieth Century, so
if you have a 386 or are running X protocol over a 28.8kbps modem, this is the
version for you!

The parent directory contains a more modern, OpenGL-based implementation.
